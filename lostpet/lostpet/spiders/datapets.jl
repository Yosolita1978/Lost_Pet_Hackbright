I will give a reward for her \"Safe\" return.Please Read:While I know there is a possibility somebody has her, I also think there is a good chance she is out there roaming free, going undetected, because she is a small dog and she will hide.  She could be on someone's property and you wouldn't even know she was there. She is not a barker.  Please take a moment to check if possible!!  Finding this little girl again is the world to me.The last sightings of her was on San Miguel off Hopper and a different sighting on Barnes Rd off Hopper.  She seems to come out, in the afternoon, around 4 pm.  The latest sighting was the one on Barnes Rd which was on Monday, 1/16/17.The previous sightings of her was in late December, on Woolsey Rd, behind the wineries.  She was seen by several different people on the side of the road but took off when people tried to get close.  If you see her during the day please contact me or contact Animal Control and if possible keep her in your sight.  Just please do not try to approach her.Before that the sighting was off Fulton Rd, and before that it was the  Brompton Ave & Francisco Ave area.***If you see a dog that you think might be her, please take a picture and send it the phone number listed if possible with the location and your name.  She does not have a leash on, and if you try to come to close, she will run. She will not try to get close to another animal.  ****She is listed on Josie's Lost Dog of Sonoma CountyShe is a very special little girl. I love her so much and life has been very difficult since she's been gone.  All we want is for her to be home.Until I get her back, her post will remain up.*Note*  I have signs up all over, and I will probably put more up, but, I promise to take each and every one down once she is found and home.  I appreciate everybody's patience.Sonoma County Animal Services:9-5 Tuesday - SaturdayCA Relay Services:  711Sonoma Humane SocietyAnd, if you found a lost animal after hours, you can take it to:PetCare  2425 Mendocino Ave  Santa Rosa, CA 95403",

    "description": "$500 Reward to the Hero Who helps us bring Our Precious Little Dog Home!We are so distraught that our precious little 10 year-old female Chihuahua is still not home with us. The rains continue to pour and we are all the more worried and frightened that we haven't received any news of her whereabouts. We check the shelters and online lost & found sites daily, we've distributed hundreds of flyers and posters, we've posted to Craiglist and hired numerous tracking and alert services - with zero success so far.  But perhaps YOU hold the key to finding her and you are reading this at just the right time!WE ARE OFFERING A $500 REWARD for any information that will lead to her return home. If you have ANY Information that might help us, please contact us as soon as possible - you will be our HERO FOREVER if your help leads Minette back to us!We still cling to the hope that some well-meaning person has taken her in during all the stormy weather and is planning to bring her to a vet or shelter to read her chip, or is actively looking for information about the lost treasure they found whose owners must most certainly be frantically fretting about.Or maybe someone took her in and fell so in love with her that they just couldn't help themselves from holding onto her. For that someone, we hope they will eventually see this ad and realize how much we have grown to love her over the years and how irreplaceable she is to us. We hope that person will see this ad and have a change of heart.Maybe you know someone who has recently come into possession of a new little dog that looks like Minette, or you've seen someone walking a dog that fits her description. If so, please text us a picture. Any lead that you think might help us will be appreciated enormously!As I have written before, Minette was last seen just as a heavy rain settled over Albany for the evening, in the 900 block of Stannage Ave. - about 1 \u00bd blocks from the Albany Twin theater. She did not have her collar or tags at the time, but she was wearing a dark gray vest (a \"Thunder Shirt\"). A couple of possible nearby sightings keep us hopeful that she is still in the area.She is beige/tan/light brown, is spayed, and has a chip.. She is about 9 years old, and weighs about 10 lbs. She needs dental work (dental surgery was already scheduled), she has ongoing skin allergies, and is now a week behind on her meds.A few pictures are attached. Please help bring Minette back home to Simone and me. We are so lonely without her and miss her terribly.A $500 reward will be offered for her return - no explanations necessary - we just want our little girl home where she is missed and so adored.THANK YOU!",

Her eyes are green.-- She used to be plump but not so much now.-- She weighs about 10 pounds. 6 years old.She is also known as \"Courtyard Cat\" because she lovedto hang outside in the courtyard commons.  And, also \"The Greeter\"because she took it as her job to greet everyone living in the courtyardas they came home or went outside.  One reason why we miss her so much is shewould greet us almost every time we went outside.She is in an indoor/outdoor cat.  But, she liked to sleep outside evenwhen cold (probably because of her very thick coat) but inside if it wascold & Raining.  Often, even if she slept inside, she'd be out the back \"cat door\"in the morning by the time we got up.  Otherwise, she preferred to usethe front door - hence, she is also called \"In & Out Cat!\"because we had to let her in and out so many times each day.Ohhh, we soooo miss you Mango!Please send us a note, if you see her or know where she is or,if you want to deliver/return her, have us pick her up for the reward.Or, she has a CHIP - Just take her to a shelter and they can scan her and will call us to pick her up.Thank you.Note: I just got the notice from her vet that she is due for her Purevax rabies shot.",
