 'description': u'" I hold that, the more helpless a creature,  the more entitled it is to protection by man  from the cruelty of man."....Mahatma GandiFor those who have STOLEN a pet, or who have FOUND a pet without reporting him/her to the local shelter or have NOT tried to locate the families of these pets and decided to keep him/her or give them away...which is still considered THEFT....here is something to think about:Imagine, if you have the empathy, what the families of these pets are going through; the heartache, the mental anguish, as well as the financial hardship that they are forced to endure as they scrape together reward money....which MANY on fixed incomes just don\'t have!Of course this is not limited to the humans involved. Keep in mind these frightened and confused animals are suffering as well! PLEASE try to think about what helpless and powerless feels like for these pets who so desperately want to be back with their families!Once you have taken this in realize that it really does come down to you to do the right thing and either take the pet to ANY animal care & control, OR contact the family.Now, imagine if this were to be the last day of your life what actions would you take?For your sake AND the community in which you live I would hope you would engage in several acts of kindness and compassion....AS IF IT\'S THE VERY LAST DAY OF YOUR LIFE!Think about it....it really all comes down to you!Please take these pets to your local animal care & control or contact the families....effortless, no questions asked.If you see a cat, dog, rabbit, wandering about ...don\'t assume the owner is close by....good chance they may be lost and they need to be gotten out of harms way.Start by checking the collar for ID tags and if they really do appear to be lost then take them to a vet or animal hospital to have scanned for a micro-chip....service is free.IN ADDITION if you come across a DECEASED animal PLEASE have the good sense to contact your local animal care and control or if possible take the pet to your local shelter where they can scan for a chip and put the body on ice until the owner is located....again, shelters are the first place most go and not everyone uses social media. IF the shelter is closed a 24/7 emergency pet hosp. would most likely be the place to go as they will cover until the shelter opens.DO NOT think you\'re doing anyone any favors by leaving the pet at a curb thinking the owner will find him/her.I think most would agree that 2016 has been one awful year and we all need a little compassion and kindness.Lets all try to do our part in helping one another through these times.Blessings!',

She was not microchipped then, but the THIEF who refused to return her, as confirmed via a 4th party, has likely chipped her as her own, rather than go and adopt/save a shelter dog in true need.  Ella belongs back home with us in Richmond N & E.  Please help keep an eye out for her, not online, but when you are out an about!She has a thick blended black and tan (sable) coat with a partial cream chest and a distinct, sharp lines making up her face mask. She is NOT solid black and tan. Her legs are only approx. 5" long. Her lower legs and paws are all tan with all black nails. The back side of her lower hind legs have some light black coloring, but her hind side is otherwise mostly tan.  She has a bushy tail that typically stands up with a slight bend.Her last valid reported sighting was along Pierce Street, and also by Central Ave/Carlson in Albany, on approx. 01/20/16, before she was dognapped at the Berkeley/El Cerrito border.  If you should spot her, please send a photo of her, particularly with her walking thief, so called parent, and location information.  Thank you!',

 'description': u'My little girl has been lost since 08/25/16.  I will give a reward for her "Safe" return.Please Read:While I know there is a possibility somebody has her, I also think there is a good chance she is out there roaming free, going undetected, because she is a small dog and she will hide.  She could be on someone\'s property and you wouldn\'t even know she was there. She is not a barker.  Please take a moment to check if possible!!  Finding this little girl again is the world to me.If you have a dog that might be my missing little girl, send me a picture of her to help confirm whether or not it\'s her, I get her back safely,  and I will double the reward, no questions asked.The last sightings of her was on San Miguel off Hopper and a different sighting on Barnes Rd off Hopper.  She seems to come out, in the afternoon, around 4 pm.  The latest sighting was the one on Barnes Rd which was on Monday, 1/16/17.The previous sightings of her was in late December, on Woolsey Rd, behind the wineries.  She was seen by several different people on the side of the road but took off when people tried to get close.  If you see her during the day please contact me or contact Animal Control and if possible keep her in your sight.  Just please do not try to approach her.Before that the sighting was off Fulton Rd, and before that it was the  Brompton Ave & Francisco Ave area.***If you see a dog that you think might be her, please take a picture and send it the phone number listed if possible with the location and your name.  She does not have a leash on, and if you try to come to close, she will run. She will not try to get close to another animal.  ****She is listed on Josie\'s Lost Dog of Sonoma CountyShe is a very special little girl. I love her so much and life has been very difficult since she\'s been gone.  All we want is for her to be home.Until I get her back, her post will remain up.*Note*  I have signs up all over, and I will probably put more up, but, I promise to take each and every one down once she is found and home.  I appreciate everybody\'s patience.Sonoma County Animal Services:9-5 Tuesday - SaturdayCA Relay Services:  711Sonoma Humane SocietyAnd, if you found a lost animal after hours, you can take it to:PetCare  2425 Mendocino Ave  Santa Rosa, CA 95403',

 'description': u'$500 Reward to the Hero Who helps us bring Our Precious Little Dog Home!We are so distraught that our precious little 10 year-old female Chihuahua is still not home with us. The rains continue to pour and we are all the more worried and frightened that we haven\'t received any news of her whereabouts. We check the shelters and online lost & found sites daily, we\'ve distributed hundreds of flyers and posters, we\'ve posted to Craiglist and hired numerous tracking and alert services - with zero success so far.  But perhaps YOU hold the key to finding her and you are reading this at just the right time!WE ARE OFFERING A $500 REWARD for any information that will lead to her return home. If you have ANY Information that might help us, please contact us as soon as possible - you will be our HERO FOREVER if your help leads Minette back to us!We still cling to the hope that some well-meaning person has taken her in during all the stormy weather and is planning to bring her to a vet or shelter to read her chip, or is actively looking for information about the lost treasure they found whose owners must most certainly be frantically fretting about.Or maybe someone took her in and fell so in love with her that they just couldn\'t help themselves from holding onto her. For that someone, we hope they will eventually see this ad and realize how much we have grown to love her over the years and how irreplaceable she is to us. We hope that person will see this ad and have a change of heart.Maybe you know someone who has recently come into possession of a new little dog that looks like Minette, or you\'ve seen someone walking a dog that fits her description. If so, please text us a picture. Any lead that you think might help us will be appreciated enormously!As I have written before, Minette was last seen just as a heavy rain settled over Albany for the evening, in the 900 block of Stannage Ave. - about 1 \xbd blocks from the Albany Twin theater. She did not have her collar or tags at the time, but she was wearing a dark gray vest (a "Thunder Shirt"). A couple of possible nearby sightings keep us hopeful that she is still in the area.She is beige/tan/light brown, is spayed, and has a chip.. She is about 9 years old, and weighs about 10 lbs. She needs dental work (dental surgery was already scheduled), she has ongoing skin allergies, and is now a week behind on her meds.A few pictures are attached. Please help bring Minette back home to Simone and me. We are so lonely without her and miss her terribly.A $500 reward will be offered for her return - no explanations necessary - we just want our little girl home where she is missed and so adored.THANK YOU!',

Max was seen by the local residents and reported to animal control during the week of 15-20Nov2013; however, animal control was not able to catch him.  If found, please contact me with a current picture of Max and an award will be settled. Thank you for your help. v/r MojoUPDATES: still looking for Max.  On 4Dec2015, i was notified that Max had been seen on Alamo Way in Pittsburg, CA area for about two weeks.
